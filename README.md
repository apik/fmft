# FMFT-Fully Massive Four-loop Tadpoles

**FMFT** is a [FORM](https://github.com/vermaseren/form) package for
reduction fully masive four-loop tadpole integrals to set of master
integrals. For correct operation **FMFT** needs last [development
version of FORM](https://github.com/vermaseren/form) or at least
**FORM** version 4 available as precompiled binary.


## Basic topologies

![FMFT topologies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/apik/fmft/topo.png)

## Input and examples

For input we use `d1,...,d10` as massive denominators according to
topologies `H` and `X` defined as `d_i=p_i^2-m^2`, and mass is set
equal to one.



```
#-
#include fmft.hh

L ex = p2.p3*p2.p2/d1^-2/d2^2/d3^0/d4^1/d5^1/d6^1/d7^1/d8^1/d9^3/d10^0;

#call fmft
#call exp4d(1)

b ep;
Print+s;
.end
```

## Speed tests

To compare with C++ version of **FIRE** package used with rules
generated by **LiteRed** we calculate following integral:

```
L ex = d1^`N'/d2/d3/d4/d5/d6/d7/d8/d9/d10
```

Execution time present for different powers of numerator. **FIRE**
used in `#memory` mode with 8 cores and **FMFT** run with parallel
version of **FORM** with 8 workers `tform -w8`. Time format is
*hh:mm:ss*

## Tables for irreducible scalar products

By default distributed with package and loaded automaticaly tables for
irreducible scalar products up to weight 10. If higher power of
irreducible scalar prodocts need to be reduced additional tables can
be downloaded:


[Tables for irreducible scalar products with powers from 11 to 20](https://dl.bintray.com/apik/FMFT/)

To start using them simply unpack archives into directory `isp` and
before including `fmft.hh` define new maximal rank of tensor
structures in numerator with directive `#define SPMAXRANK "<WEIGHT>"`,
where `<WEIGHT>` is a maximal weight of tables you want to load.
